# COMP9024

## Introduction

As suggested by the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), Python and C stand out as the two most 
popular programming languages.

Python, introduced in COMP9021, provides a higher-level abstraction (e.g., garbage collection).
Known for its simplicity and versatility, Python has gained widespread adoption in various domains, 
from web development and software security to AI. 

On the other hand, C, renowned for its efficiency and control over hardware, remains a cornerstone in system programming (e.g., [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [Python Interpreter](https://github.com/python/cpython)) and embedded systems. 

Interestingly, the official Python interpreter, [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), is written in C.

In fact, COMP9024 is a 2-in-1 course.  It consists of two parts:

1. The C Programming Language

2. Data Structures and Algorithms

Together, we have **Data Structures and Algorithms in C**.
