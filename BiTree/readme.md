# Binary Tree



## 1. How to create/visit a binary tree?

```sh

    
An expression (i.e., a string) from a user:

   "9000 + 6 * 4" 

An interpreter based on a binary tree:


        + 
      /   \ 
    9000   * 
          /  \ 
         6    4 


   eval("9000 + 6 * 4") = 9024


Its intermediate representation (IR): 

	 t1 = 6 * 4
	 t2 = 9000 + t1


```    


## 2. The real-world application of data structures and algorithms.

```sh 

In fact, the data structures—such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs—covered 
in COMP9024 find extensive practical application in real-world interpreters and compilers.

```

### 2.1 Python Interpreter
```sh                                                       

    $ python3

    >>> eval("9000 + 6 * 4")
    9024

    >>> code = compile("9000 + 6 * 4", "", "eval")
    >>> eval(code)
    9024

    >>> help(eval)

    eval(source, globals=None, locals=None)
    
        Evaluate the given source in the context of globals and locals.
        The source may be a string representing a Python expression
        or a code object as returned by compile().    
```
